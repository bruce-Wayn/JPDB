# JPDB - An introductory project for new JS PowerDB users

This repository is solely made in order to accomplish the sense of how a JS Power DB system works when integrated with the concepts of JS. It consists of a simple program for saving employee data using an application programming interface

In this exercise we follow the path to simply create an employee profile using the JPDB functionality "PUT" with the help of a token for api, followed by the command, database name, relationa name and a jsonString which contains the whole body with great employee contents when he/she gets hired in the format given below:

jsonStr: {"keysAsOnDatabase":"valuesAsAssignedToKeysInDatabase"}

to understand more about the utility of json Power DB I'd appriciate you take time with **this website**:

Or

you can learn the basics from the screenshots below:

1. **PUT or Create**

_Now in order to understand the funcionalities of all the above 4 basic commands you would first need to understand the different url structures get and the rest of the manipulation commands have because then and only then we will be able to run the right operation over right base url._

**N**ow we will look at some of out results for PUT and Remove combined with the api program we created in order to establist a sample database to add employee information

1. using just commands
